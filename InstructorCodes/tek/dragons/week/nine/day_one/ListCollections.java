	 * - ArrayList and LinkedList are flexible in size. (re-sizable)
	 * - ArrayList and LinkedList are Generic Type. 
	 * - Both of them takes only non-primitive data type and Generic Type. 
	 * - To use primitive data type we have to use Wrapper Classes. 
	 * 
	 * Differences: 
	 * - LinkedList have references about previous and Next Element.
