	 * 1) HashSet
	 * 	- HashSet is A Class Implements by Set interface. 
	 * 	- HashSet NOT accepting duplicated values (References).
	 * 	- there is no Order on HashSet. 
	 * 	- There is no Indexing accessible in HashSet. 
	 * 	- Only way to retrieve data in HashSet is to loop through them 
	 * 		using for each. 
	 * 2) TreeSet
	 * - TreeSet is a Class Implements by Set Interface. 
	 * - TreeSet is Unordered collection. 
	 * - TreeSet is Unique Collection.
	 * - There is no Index accessible in TreeSet. 
	 * - Only way to retrieve data in TreeSet is to loop through them 
	 * 		using for each. 
	 * - Values will the sorted internally in TreeSet

	 * Differences between List and Set
	 * 1) Set have no Index , List base on Index
	 * 2) set is un-order , list is oder base on entry
	 * 3) set is Unique , List is Accepting duplicate
	 * 4) to retrieve data for Set have to user for each loop, 
	 * 		List we can retrieve by index number
